# Deep-Learning-Alphabet-Soup

## Overview
### Nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With machine learning and neural networks, used the features in the dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

### From Alphabet Soup’s business team, a CSV was received containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization.

### Process:
* Using Pandas and scikit-learn’s StandardScaler(), preprocessed the dataset.
* Compiled, trained, and evaluated the neural network model using TensorFlow. Designed a neural network (deep learning model) to create a binary classification model that predicted if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset.
* Optimized thd model by altering cutoff bins, included features, and by creating an auto optimizer to determine the optimal activation functions, hidden layers, nodes, and epochs.
